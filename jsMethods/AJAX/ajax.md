# AJAX

> Asynchrnous Javascript and XML (JSON)

AJAX is a method of building interactive application that process requests without refreshing the page.

EX: A weather site that could display your local weather on one side of the page as soon as you enter your location.
This data is probably fetched in the background (through AJAX) so that the page does not have to reload.

## Advantages

 -Faster: this is probably the most obvious advantage to AJAX. Every time the page reloads the browser must make a bunch of request for html/css/js, etc.
